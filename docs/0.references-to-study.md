- [Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with Node.js: Organizing Your Application](https://medium.com/@alessandro.traversi/domain-driven-design-ddd-with-node-js-organizing-your-application-60b3ec0c9efe )
    - **Summary:** "Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes the importance of understanding and modeling the domain of a problem before designing the software solution. When combined with Node.js, DDD can provide a powerful framework for building scalable and maintainable applications. In this post, we will explore how to effectively organize a Node.js application using DDD principles, with a focus on separating business rules, application rules, and infrastructure."

  - **Summary:** "In this article, we will cover a way to write your NodeJS code with typescript that is scalable and easy to reason about. Additionally, we will apply CQRS and domain driven design principles, even if the domain is not yet well-known. Afterward, we will discuss how to scale the application and what can be done to split it into several microservices."
